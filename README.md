## Notes

- This extension should be compatible with any Firefox / Chromium based browser.

- This extension was inspired by **[Unnecessary Inventions][UI YouTube]** and the browser extension **[Youtube Mrbeastify][UI MrBeastify]**.

- This extension is unofficial and not affiliated with DougDoug or YouTube.

## Microsoft Edge <a id="microsoftedge"></a>

Microsoft Edge support has been ended, and the extension has been delisted. This is because Edge is consistently the slowest at reviewing extensions, constantly rejects my submissions with vague reasons why, and are allround terrible. Download the Chrome version instead.
